# Spacewar
Love2D port of Spacewar!

This project is meant to serve as an example project for other Love2D game developers to learn from, and will hopefully serve as a decent springboard for anyone hoping to become a bit more familiar with the framwork. It will ultimately include examples of networking, joystick support, shaders and a variety of other features found within Love2D.

The feature set will expand as time goes on (assuming I actually get around to working on this).

Anyone is free to contribute, and no strict styleguide is enforced. Just try to keep it similiar to whatever file you happen to be working in -- commits to regulate style are welcomed -- but I prefer tabs over spaces and camelCase over underscores_where_appropriate.
